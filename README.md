# BluetoothDistanceApp
An app to test the idea of trying to discover the distance between two phones running the app.

Early tests indicated that the methods used with this app (time-of-flight, signal strength measurements) would not work well enough for our capstone, so the project is effectively discontinued. See the ARLocationTracking project's final report for a little more information on this.
